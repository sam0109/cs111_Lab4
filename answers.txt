# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

There were two locations where strcpy was used to copy a filename directly 
from the peer's request. A long filename could have caused a segfault or 
buffer overrun, so it was fixed using strncpy with the max filename size 
as the max size argument. Each location is marked with a comment.

We also made sure that the peer did not pass in a filename larger than
FILENAMESIZ in order to avoid huge buffers that could crash the host.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We added a check to make sure that the peer is not asking for 
anything outside the current directory by checking for ".." and "/" 
and moving to the next peer if those strings are found.

We increased the size of TASKBUFSIZ so that we can allow more connections

We implemented a maximum file size so that the machine cannot be flooded with 
useless data

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
